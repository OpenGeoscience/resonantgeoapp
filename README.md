# Introduction
ResonantGeoView is a geospatial web application and framework created to enable users to upload, visualize, and analyze small to large geospatial data from a web interface. ResonantGeoView uses advancements in web and database technologies such as WebGL and  NoSQL(MongoDB) database. It is designed for big data and cloud enabled data analysis and visualization.

Some of the highlights of ResonantGeoView include using a web-enabled data management [Girder](http://www.github.com/Girder/girder) to manage data, metadata, sessions and employing high-performance geospatial data visualization library [GeoJS](http://www.github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs)
to provide fast interactive visualization of geospatial data on a map. ResonantGeoView backend uses open-source tools such as Gaia, GDAL, Shapely, and Fiona for performing geospatial data I/O, filtering, and spatial analysis.
